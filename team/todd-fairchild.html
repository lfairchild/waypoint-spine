      <p>&ldquo;I treat all patients how I want my family to be treated. I first sit down with patients and try to figure out how they can maximize non-operative treatment and <strong>avoid</strong> surgery. If all non-operative treatments have failed and if I am able to clearly identify the anatomic abnormality causing pain, I discuss the risk and benefits of spine surgery. If we proceed with surgery, I utilize the most modern techniques and instrumentation, including minimally invasive procedures.&rdquo;<p>
